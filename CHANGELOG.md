## [4.1.0] - 2025-11-10

### 🎉 Tool Calling & Agent CLI Release

Version 4.1 introduces **unified tool calling architecture** enabling AI agents to perform actions like call transfers and email management, plus production-ready **Agent CLI tools** for operations.

### Added

#### Tool Calling System
- **Unified Tool Architecture**: Write tools once, use with any provider
  - Base classes: `Tool`, `ToolDefinition`, `ToolRegistry` (`src/tools/base.py`, 231 lines)
  - Execution context with session and ARI access (`src/tools/context.py`, 108 lines)
  - Singleton registry for tool management (`src/tools/registry.py`, 198 lines)
  - Provider adapters for Deepgram (202 lines) and OpenAI Realtime (215 lines)

#### Telephony Tools
- **Transfer Call Tool**: Warm and blind transfers with direct SIP origination
  - `src/tools/telephony/transfer.py` (504 lines)
  - Department name resolution (e.g., "support" → extension 6000)
  - Warm transfer: AI stays on line until agent answers
  - Blind transfer: Immediate redirect
  - Production validated: <150ms execution time
  - Call IDs: `1762731796.4233` (Deepgram), `1762734947.4251` (OpenAI)
- **Cancel Transfer Tool**: Cancel in-progress transfer before agent answers
  - `src/tools/telephony/cancel_transfer.py`
  - Allows caller to change mind during ring
- **Hangup Call Tool**: Graceful call termination with farewell message
  - `src/tools/telephony/hangup.py`
  - Customizable farewell message
  - Works with all providers

#### Email Tools
- **Request Transcript Tool**: Caller-initiated transcript delivery
  - `src/tools/business/request_transcript.py` (475 lines)
  - Email parsing from speech ("john dot smith at gmail dot com")
  - Domain validation via DNS MX record lookup
  - Confirmation flow (AI reads back email for verification)
  - Deduplication (prevents sending same email multiple times)
  - Admin receives BCC on all transcript requests
  - Resend API integration
- **Send Email Summary Tool**: Auto-send call summaries to admin
  - `src/tools/business/email_summary.py` (347 lines)
  - Triggered automatically after every call
  - Full conversation transcript with timestamps
  - Call metadata (duration, caller ID, date/time)
  - Professional HTML formatting
  - Admin email configuration in YAML

#### Agent CLI Tools
- **Binary Distribution System**:
  - Makefile build system for 5 platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated releases (`.github/workflows/release-cli.yml`)
  - One-line installer: `curl -sSL ... | bash` (`scripts/install-cli.sh`, 223 lines)
  - SHA256 checksums for security verification
  - Automated binary uploads to GitHub releases
- **CLI Commands**:

  - Windows AMD64
  - Pre-built binaries with automatic platform detection

#### Conversation Tracking
- **Real-time Tracking**: Both Deepgram and OpenAI Realtime track conversation turns
  - `conversation_history` field in `CallSession` model
  - Tracks role (user/assistant), content, and timestamps
  - Enables email tools to include full transcripts
  - Pattern identical across providers (46-51 lines each)

### Improved

#### Warm Transfer Implementation
- **Direct SIP Endpoint Origination**: Eliminates Local channel complexity
  - Previous: Used `Local/{ext}@{context}/n` → caused unidirectional audio
  - Current: Direct SIP origination (e.g., `SIP/6000`)
  - Result: Perfect bidirectional audio confirmed
  - No Local channels created (verified in production)
- **4-Step Cleanup Sequence**:
  1. Remove AI channel from bridge (<50ms)
  2. Stop provider session gracefully (<30ms)
  3. Add agent SIP channel to bridge (<20ms)
  4. Update session metadata (<10ms)
  - Total: <150ms for complete transfer execution
- **Production Validation**:
  - Call duration: 38+ seconds after transfer (stable)
  - Bridge type: simple_bridge (optimal, 2 channels only)
  - Audio path: Direct (1 hop, minimal latency)
  - Files: `src/tools/telephony/transfer.py`, `src/engine.py` (transfer handler)

#### OpenAI Realtime Stability
- **VAD Re-enable Timing Fix**: Correct event for greeting protection
  - Issue: Used `response.audio.done` (fires per segment) → VAD enabled too early
  - Fix: Changed to `response.done` (fires when complete response generated)
  - Impact: Greeting now plays completely before accepting interruptions
  - Lines: `src/providers/openai_realtime.py` (1206-1219)
- **API Modality Constraints**: Documented OpenAI requirements
  - Supported: `["text"]` or `["audio", "text"]`
  - Not supported: `["audio"]` alone (API rejects)
  - Known limitation: May occasionally generate text-only responses
  - Mitigation: System handles gracefully with keepalive messages
- **Race Condition Handling**: Handles variable event arrival order
  - Sometimes: `response.done` arrives before audio deltas
  - Other times: Audio deltas arrive first
  - Solution: Check `had_audio_burst` flag, re-enable VAD regardless

### Fixed

- **AAVA-57**: Direct SIP endpoint origination for warm transfers
  - Root cause: Local channels caused audio direction mismatch
  - Solution: Direct `SIP/extension` origination
  - Evidence: Call logs show no Local channels, perfect audio
- **AAVA-58**: Local channel audio direction issue (RCA documented)
  - Symptom: Caller heard agent, but agent couldn't hear caller
  - Root cause: Audio path `caller → Local;2 → Local;1 → nowhere`
  - Solution: Eliminated Local channels entirely
- **AAVA-59**: AI provider cleanup during transfer
  - Issue: AI stayed in bridge after agent answered
  - Solution: Remove external media channel before adding agent
  - Result: Clean 2-channel bridge (caller + agent only)
- **AAVA-62**: OpenAI Realtime audio generation analysis and constraints
  - Issue #1: Greeting interrupted (VAD enabled too early)
  - Issue #2: 45-second silence (OpenAI generated text-only)
  - Solution: Correct VAD timing + documented API limitation
  - Commits: `85c4235`, `80efdcd`, `6dbd51e`
- **AAVA-52**: Email tools race conditions and missing await
  - Bug #1: `context.get_session()` called without `await`
  - Bug #2: Auto-summary triggered async, session removed first
  - Bug #3: Undefined `caller_id` variable
  - Bug #4: No email confirmation flow
  - Bug #5: Duplicate emails when caller corrected address
  - Commits: `1deed05`, `700993f`, `5579ddd`, `a2d9409`, `835ac05`

### Known Limitations

- **OpenAI Realtime**: May occasionally generate text-only responses
  - Root cause: API limitation with `["audio", "text"]` modalities
  - Frequency: Varies (test call had 2/4 responses without audio)
  - Impact: Caller experiences brief silence
  - Mitigation: System handles gracefully with keepalive messages
  - Not fixable: Cannot force OpenAI to always generate audio
- **Tool Calling**: Currently Deepgram and OpenAI Realtime only
  - Custom Pipeline support planned for v4.3 (AAVA-56)
  - Other providers: Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini (v4.3+)

### Architecture Validation

**Provider-Agnostic Design Confirmed**:
- Same tool code (504 lines for transfer) works with both providers
- Only adapters differ (202 lines Deepgram, 215 lines OpenAI)
- Zero code duplication in tool logic
- Adding new providers requires <250 lines of adapter code

**Line Counts**:
- Tool calling framework: 537 lines (base + context + registry)
- Transfer call tool: 504 lines (shared by all providers)
- Email summary tool: 347 lines (shared)
- Request transcript tool: 475 lines (shared)
- Deepgram adapter: 202 lines
- OpenAI adapter: 215 lines
- **Total duplication**: 0 lines ✅

### Performance Metrics

**Transfer Tool**:
- Transfer execution: <150ms
- AI cleanup time: <100ms
- Bridge technology: simple_bridge (optimal)
- Audio path: Direct (1 hop)
- Call stability: 38+ seconds validated

**Email Tools**:
- Email validation: <100ms (DNS MX lookup)
- Email delivery: ~200ms (Resend API)
- Conversation tracking: Real-time (no performance impact)
