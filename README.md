## 🛠️ AI-Powered Actions (v4.3+)

Your AI agent can perform real-world telephony actions through tool calling, now validated across **all pipeline types** including local hybrid:

### Unified Call Transfers

Single tool handles all transfer types:

```
Caller: "Transfer me to the sales team"
Agent: "I'll connect you to our sales team right away."
[Transfer to sales queue with queue music]

Caller: "I need technical support"
Agent: "Let me transfer you to technical support."
[Direct transfer to support agent extension]

Caller: "Connect me to customer service"
Agent: "I'll transfer you to our customer service ring group."
[Transfer to ring group, multiple agents ring]
```

**Transfer Destinations:**
- **Extensions**: Direct SIP/PJSIP endpoint transfers
- **Queues**: ACD queue transfers with position announcements
- **Ring Groups**: Multiple agents ring simultaneously

### Call Control

**Cancel Transfer** (during ring):
```
Agent: "Let me transfer you to support..."
Caller: "Actually, cancel that"
Agent: "No problem, I've cancelled the transfer. How can I help?"
```

**Hangup Call** (with farewell):
```
Caller: "That's all I needed, thanks!"
Agent: "Thank you for calling. Goodbye!"
[Call ends gracefully]
```

### Voicemail

```
Caller: "Can I leave a voicemail for John?"
Agent: "Of course! I'll transfer you to John's voicemail."
[Routes to voicemail box, caller records message]
```

### Email Integration

**Automatic Call Summaries**:
After every call, admins receive:
- Full conversation transcript
- Call duration and metadata
- Caller information
- Professional HTML formatting

**Caller-Requested Transcripts**:
```
Caller: "Can you email me a transcript of this call?"
Agent: "I'd be happy to! What email address should I use?"
Caller: "john dot smith at gmail dot com"
Agent: "That's john.smith@gmail.com - is that correct?"
Caller: "Yes"
Agent: "Perfect! I'll send the transcript there shortly."
[Email sent with full conversation transcript]
```

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `transfer` | Transfer to extensions, queues, or ring groups | ✅ |
| `cancel_transfer` | Cancel in-progress transfer (during ring) | ✅ |
| `hangup_call` | End call gracefully with farewell message | ✅ |

```

Supports Linux, macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), and Windows. See [CLI Tools Guide](cli/README.md) for complete reference.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in **5 minutes** with our new interactive wizard:

### Option A: Interactive Quickstart (Recommended for First-Time Users)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/hkjarral/Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent.git
cd Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent

# Run installer (sets up Docker and offers CLI installation)
./install.sh

# After installation, run interactive setup wizard
agent quickstart
```

The wizard will:
* ✅ Guide you through provider selection
* ✅ Validate your API keys
* ✅ Test Asterisk ARI connection
* ✅ Generate dialplan configuration
* ✅ Provide next steps

### Option B: Manual Setup (Advanced Users)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hkjarral/Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent.git
cd Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
* Guide you through **3 simple configuration choices**
* Prompt for required API keys (only what you need)
* Set up Docker containers automatically
* Offer CLI installation

**Choose Your Configuration:**

* **[1] OpenAI Realtime** - Fastest setup, modern AI (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
* **[2] Deepgram Voice Agent** - Enterprise features (requires `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
* **[3] Local Hybrid** - Privacy-focused (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`, 8GB+ RAM)

### 3. Configure Asterisk Dialplan

**Option 1: Use the CLI helper:**
```bash
agent dialplan --provider openai_realtime
```

**Option 2: Manual configuration:**

Add this to your FreePBX (Config Edit → extensions_custom.conf):

```asterisk
[from-ai-agent]
exten => s,1,NoOp(Asterisk AI Voice Agent v4.3)
 same => n,Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

Then create a Custom Destination pointing to `from-ai-agent,s,1` and route calls to it.

### 4. Test Your Agent

Make a call to your configured destination and have a conversation!

**Health check:**
```bash
agent doctor
```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f ai-engine
```

**That's it!** Your AI voice agent is ready. 🎉

For detailed setup, see [CLI Tools Guide](cli/README.md) or [FreePBX Integration Guide](docs/FreePBX-Integration-Guide.md)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Two-File Configuration

* **[`config/ai-agent.yaml`](config/ai-agent.yaml)** - Golden baseline configs
* **[`.env`](.env.example)** - Secrets and API keys (git-ignored)

The installer handles everything automatically. To customize:

**Change greeting or persona**:
Edit `config/ai-agent.yaml`:
```yaml
llm:
  initial_greeting: "Your custom greeting"
  prompt: "Your custom AI persona"
```

**Add/change API keys**:
Edit `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-key-here
ASTERISK_ARI_USERNAME=asterisk
ASTERISK_ARI_PASSWORD=your-password
```

**Switch configurations**:
```bash
# Copy a different golden baseline
cp config/ai-agent.golden-deepgram.yaml config/ai-agent.yaml
docker compose up -d --force-recreate ai-engine
```

### Optional: Enterprise Monitoring

If you enabled monitoring during installation, you have Prometheus + Grafana running:

**Access Grafana:**
```
http://your-server-ip:3000
Username: admin
Password: admin (change after first login)
```

**If you didn't enable monitoring during install**, you can start it anytime:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d
```

**Stop monitoring:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml down
```

**Note:** Monitoring is completely optional. The AI agent works without it. See [monitoring/README.md](monitoring/README.md) for dashboards, alerts, and metrics.

* [docs/Configuration-Reference.md](docs/Configuration-Reference.md) - Complete reference
* [docs/Transport-Mode-Compatibility.md](docs/Transport-Mode-Compatibility.md) - Transport modes

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

Two-container architecture for performance and scalability:

**`ai-engine`** (Lightweight orchestrator)
* Connects to Asterisk via ARI
* Manages call lifecycle
* Routes audio to/from AI providers
* Handles state management

**`local-ai-server`** (Optional, for Local Hybrid)
* Runs local STT/TTS models
* Vosk (speech-to-text)
* Piper (text-to-speech)
* WebSocket interface

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌───────────┐      ┌───────────────────┐
│ Asterisk Server │◀────▶│ ai-engine │◀────▶│ AI Provider       │
│ (ARI, RTP)      │      │ (Docker)  │      │ (Cloud or Local)  │

                           ▼     │
                         ┌─────────────────┐

                         └─────────────────┘
```

**Key Design Principles**:
* Separation of concerns - AI processing isolated from call handling
* Modular pipelines - Mix and match STT, LLM, TTS providers
* Transport flexibility - AudioSocket (legacy) or ExternalMedia RTP (modern)
* Enterprise-ready - Monitoring, observability, production-hardened
