# Docker Compose Override: Host Network Mode
#
# ⚠️  WARNING: Host networking reduces container isolation
# Only use this for:
# - High-performance deployments (>100 concurrent calls)
# - Minimizing RTP latency
# - Same-host Asterisk installations
# - Development/testing environments
#
# SECURITY REQUIREMENTS when using host mode:
# - MUST bind to 127.0.0.1 (localhost only)
# - MUST configure strict firewall rules
# - NOT recommended for multi-tenant environments
# - See docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md section 3.1
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.host.yml up -d
#
# This will override the default bridge networking with host mode.
