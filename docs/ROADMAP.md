# AI Voice Agent Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the development and evolution of the Asterisk AI Voice Agent. It combines the foundational work (Milestones 1-7), v4.0 GA production-readiness work (Transport Orchestrator & Audio Profiles), and future enhancements.

Each milestone includes scope, implementation details, and verification criteria.

## Milestone 1 — SessionStore-Only State (✅ Completed)

- **Goal**: Remove remaining legacy dictionaries from `engine.py` and rely exclusively on `SessionStore` / `PlaybackManager` for call state.
- **Tasks**:
  - Replace reads/writes to `active_calls`, `caller_channels`, etc. with SessionStore helpers.
  - Update cleanup paths so `/health` reflects zero active sessions after hangup.
  - Add lightweight logging when SessionStore migrations hit unknown fields.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Single test call shows: ExternalMedia channel created, RTP frames logged, gating tokens add/remove, `/health` returns `active_calls: 0` within 5s of hangup.
  - No `active_calls[...]` or similar dict mutations remain in the codebase.

## Milestone 2 — Provider Switch CLI (✅ Completed)

- **Goal**: Provide one command to switch the active provider, restart the engine, and confirm readiness.
- **What We Shipped**:
  - Added `scripts/switch_provider.py` and Makefile targets `provider-switch`, `provider-switch-remote`, and `provider-reload` for local + server workflows.
  - Health endpoint now reports the active provider readiness so the change can be validated at a glance.
- **Verification**:
  - `make provider=<name> provider-reload` updates `config/ai-agent.yaml`, restarts `ai-engine`, and the next call uses the requested provider. Logged on 2025-09-22 during regression.

## Milestone 3 — Model Auto-Fetch (✅ Completed)

- **Goal**: Automatically download and cache local AI models based on the host architecture.
- **What We Shipped**:
  - Added `models/registry.json` and the `scripts/model_setup.sh` utility to detect hardware tier, download the right STT/LLM/TTS bundles, and verify integrity.
  - Makefile task `make model-setup` (documented in Agents/Architecture) calls the script and skips work when models are already cached.
- **Verification**:
  - First-run downloads populate `models/` on both laptops and the server; subsequent runs detect cached artifacts and exit quickly. Local provider boots cleanly after `make model-setup`.

## Milestone 4 — Conversation Coordinator & Metrics (✅ Completed)

- **Goal**: Centralize gating/barge-in decisions and expose observability.
- **What We Shipped**:
  - Introduced `ConversationCoordinator` (SessionStore-integrated) plus Prometheus gauges/counters for capture state and barge-in attempts.
  - Health endpoint now exposes a `conversation` summary and `/metrics` serves Prometheus data.
- **Verification**:
  - 2025-09-22 regression call shows coordinator toggling capture around playback, `ai_agent_tts_gating_active` returning to zero post-call, and `/metrics` scrape succeeding from the server.

## Milestone 5 — Streaming Transport Production Readiness (✅ Completed)

- **Goal**: Promote the AudioSocket streaming path to production quality with adaptive pacing, configurable defaults, and telemetry. Details and task breakdown live in `docs/contributing/milestones/milestone-5-streaming-transport.md`.
- **What We Shipped**:
  - Configurable streaming defaults in `config/ai-agent.yaml` (`min_start_ms`, `low_watermark_ms`, `fallback_timeout_ms`, `provider_grace_ms`, `jitter_buffer_ms`).
  - Post‑TTS end protection window (`barge_in.post_tts_end_protection_ms`) to prevent agent self‑echo when capture resumes.
  - Deepgram input alignment to 8 kHz (`providers.deepgram.input_sample_rate_hz: 8000`) to match AudioSocket frames.
  - AudioSocket default format set to μ-law with provider guardrails (`audiosocket.format=ulaw`, Deepgram/OpenAI `input_encoding=ulaw`) so inbound frames are decoded correctly.
  - Expanded YAML comments with tuning guidance for operators.
  - Regression docs updated with findings and resolutions.
- **Verification (2025‑09‑24 13:17 PDT)**:
  - Two-way telephonic conversation acceptable end‑to‑end; no echo‑loop in follow‑on turns.
  - Gating toggles around playback as expected; post‑TTS guard drops residual frames.
  - Deepgram regression replay shows no “low RMS” warnings once μ-law alignment is in place.
  - Operators can fine‑tune behaviour via YAML without code changes.

## Milestone 6 — OpenAI Realtime Voice Agent (✅ Completed)

- **Goal**: Add an OpenAI Realtime provider so Deepgram ↔️ OpenAI switching happens via configuration alone. Milestone instructions: `docs/contributing/milestones/milestone-6-openai-realtime.md`.
- **Dependencies**: Milestone 5 complete; OpenAI API credentials configured.
- **Primary Tasks**:
  - Implement `src/providers/openai_realtime.py` with streaming audio events.
  - Extend configuration schema and env documentation (`README.md`, `docs/contributing/architecture-deep-dive.md`).
  - Align provider payloads with the latest OpenAI Realtime guide:
    - Use `session.update` with nested `audio` schema and `output_modalities` (e.g., `session.audio.input.format`, `session.audio.input.turn_detection`, `session.audio.output.format`, `session.audio.output.voice`).
    - Remove deprecated/unknown fields (e.g., `session.input_audio_sample_rate_hz`).
    - Use `response.create` without `response.audio`; rely on session audio settings. For greeting, send explicit `response.instructions`.
    - Add `event_id` on client events and handle `response.done`, `response.output_audio.delta`, `response.output_audio_transcript.*`.
  - Greeting behavior: send `response.create` immediately on connect with explicit directive (e.g., “Please greet the user with the following: …”).
  - VAD/commit policy:
    - When server VAD is enabled (`session.audio.input.turn_detection`), stream with `input_audio_buffer.append` only; do not `commit`.
    - When VAD is disabled, serialize commits and aggregate ≥160 ms per commit.
- **What We Shipped**:
  - Implemented `src/providers/openai_realtime.py` with robust event handling and transcript parsing.
  - Fixed keepalive to use native WebSocket `ping()` frames (no invalid `{"type":"ping"}` payloads).
  - Resampled AudioSocket PCM16 (8 kHz) to 24 kHz before commit and advertised 24 kHz PCM16 input/output in `session.update` so OpenAI Realtime codecs stay in sync.
  - μ-law alignment: requested `g711_ulaw` from OpenAI and passed μ-law bytes directly to Asterisk (file playback path), eliminating conversion artifacts.
  - Greeting on connect using `response.create` with explicit instructions.
  - Hardened error logging to avoid structlog conflicts; added correlation and visibility of `input_audio_buffer.*` acks.
  - Added YAML streaming tuning knobs (`min_start_ms`, `low_watermark_ms`, `jitter_buffer_ms`, `provider_grace_ms`) and wired them into `StreamingPlaybackManager`.
  - Refreshed `examples/pipelines/cloud_only_openai.yaml` so the monolithic OpenAI pipeline defaults to the 24 kHz settings and works out-of-the-box.

- **Verification (2025‑09‑25 08:59 PDT)**:
  - Successful regression call with initial greeting; two-way conversation sustained.
  - Multiple agent turns played cleanly (e.g., 16000B ≈2.0s and 40000B ≈5.0s μ-law files) with proper gating and `PlaybackFinished`.
  - No OpenAI `invalid_request_error` on keepalive; ping fix validated.

- **Acceptance**:
  - Setting `default_provider: openai_realtime` results in a successful regression call with greeting and two-way audio.
  - Logs show `response.created` → output audio chunks → playback start/finish with gating clear; no `unknown_parameter` errors.

## Milestone 7 — Configurable Pipelines & Hot Reload (✅ Completed)

- **Goal**: Support multiple named pipelines (STT/LLM/TTS) defined in YAML, with hot reload for rapid iteration. See `docs/contributing/milestones/milestone-7-configurable-pipelines.md`.
- **What We Shipped**:
  - YAML pipelines with `active_pipeline` switching and safe hot reload.
  - Pipeline adapters for Local, OpenAI (Realtime + Chat), Deepgram (STT/TTS), and Google (REST) with option merging.
  - Engine integration that injects pipeline components per call and preserves in‑flight sessions across reloads.
  - Logging defaults and knobs; streaming transport integration consistent with Milestone 5.
- **Validation (2025‑09‑27 → 2025‑09‑28)**:
  - Local‑only pipeline (TinyLlama) 2‑minute regression passed: greeting, STT finals, LLM replies (6–13 s), local TTS playback.
  - Hybrid pipeline A: local STT + OpenAI LLM + local TTS passed (two‑way conversation, stable gating).
  - Hybrid pipeline B: local STT + OpenAI LLM + Deepgram TTS passed (fast greeting/turns, clean playback).
  - Evidence captured in `archived/regressions/local-call-framework.md` with timestamps, byte sizes, and latency notes.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Swapping `active_pipeline` applies on the next call after reload.
  - Custom pipeline regressions succeed using YAML only.
  - Changing OpenAI/Deepgram endpoints or voice/model via YAML takes effect on next call.

## Milestone 8 — Transport Stabilization (✅ Completed Oct 25, 2025)

- **Goal**: Eliminate audio garble and pacing issues by enforcing AudioSocket invariants and proper format handling. Details in `docs/contributing/milestones/milestone-8-transport-stabilization.md`.
- **Tag**: `v1.0-p0-transport-stable`
- **What We Shipped**:
  - Fixed critical AudioSocket format override bug (commit `1a049ce`) preventing caller codec from overriding YAML wire format settings.
  - Enforced little-endian PCM16 on AudioSocket wire; removed all egress byte-swap logic.
  - Added pacer idle cutoff (1200ms) to prevent underflows and long tails.
  - Set `chunk_size_ms: auto` with 20ms default; reframe provider chunks to pacer cadence.
  - One-shot TransportCard logging at call start showing wire/provider formats.
- **Verification (2025-10-25, Call 1761424308.2043)**:
  - Clean two-way conversation end-to-end; user confirmed "Audio pipeline is working really well."
  - Zero underflows observed; wall_seconds ≈ content duration (no long tails).
  - SNR: 64.6-68.2 dB (excellent); provider bytes ratio 1.0 (perfect alignment).
  - TransportCard present in logs; no egress swap messages anywhere.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Golden metrics match baseline within 10% tolerance.
  - No garbled greeting; underflows ≈ 0; correct AudioSocket format per YAML.

  - Provider-specific gating (opt-in per provider) integrated with OpenAI Realtime.
  - Critical VAD configuration: `webrtc_aggressiveness: 1` (balanced mode) to prevent false echo detection.
  - 24kHz PCM16 input/output format for OpenAI; server-side VAD integration.
  - Golden baseline configuration documented in `OPENAI_REALTIME_GOLDEN_BASELINE.md`.
- **Verification (2025-10-26, Call 1761449250.2163)**:
  - Duration: 45.9s, SNR: 64.7 dB; zero self-interruption events.
  - Buffered: 0 chunks (vs 50 with aggressiveness: 0); gate closures: 1 time (vs 50+).
  - Natural conversation flow validated; user feedback: "much better results" ✅
- **Acceptance**:

  - Audio profiles system in YAML: `telephony_ulaw_8k`, `openai_realtime_24k`, `wideband_pcm_16k`, `telephony_responsive`.
  - Per-call channel variable overrides (all optional; fallback to YAML):
    - `AI_PROVIDER` — which provider (deepgram, openai_realtime, local_hybrid)
    - `AI_AUDIO_PROFILE` — which transport profile
    - `AI_CONTEXT` — semantic context mapping to YAML `contexts.*` for prompt/greeting/profile
  - Provider capability negotiation with ACK parsing (Deepgram `SettingsApplied`, OpenAI `session.updated`).
  - Legacy config synthesis for backward compatibility; zero-change upgrade path.
- **Verification (2025-10-26)**:
  - Deepgram validation (Call 1761504353.2179): SNR 66.8 dB, `telephony_responsive` profile applied correctly.
  - OpenAI Realtime validation (Call 1761505357.2187): SNR 64.77 dB, `openai_realtime_24k` profile, perfect gating.
  - Dynamic profile switching via `AI_AUDIO_PROFILE` confirmed working without YAML edits.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Switching `AI_AUDIO_PROFILE` changes transport plan; call remains stable.

## Milestone 17 — Monitoring, Feedback & Guided Setup (Planned)

- **Goal**: Ship an opt-in monitoring + analytics experience that is turnkey, captures per-call transcripts/metrics, and surfaces actionable YAML tuning guidance. Implementation details live in `docs/contributing/milestones/milestone-14-monitoring-stack.md`.
- **Dependencies**: Milestones 5–7 in place so streaming telemetry, pipeline metadata, and configuration hot-reload already work.
- **Workstreams & Tasks**:
  1. **Observability Foundation**
     - Add Prometheus & Grafana services to `docker-compose.yml` with persistent volumes and optional compose profile.
     - Expose Make targets (`monitor-up`, `monitor-down`, `monitor-logs`, `monitor-status`) plus SSH-friendly variants in `tools/ide/Makefile.ide` if needed.
     - Ensure `ai-engine` and `local-ai-server` `/metrics` export call/pipeline labels (`session_uuid`, `pipeline_name`, `provider_id`, `model_variant`).
  2. **Call Analytics & Storage**
     - Extend `SessionStore` (or dedicated collector) to emit end-of-call summaries: duration, turn count, fallback/jitter totals, sentiment score placeholder, pipeline + model names.
     - Archive transcripts and the associated config snapshot per call (e.g., `monitoring/call_sessions/<uuid>.jsonl` + `settings.json`).
     - Publish Prometheus metrics for recommendations (`ai_agent_setting_recommendation_total{field="streaming.low_watermark_ms"}`) and sentiment/quality trends.
  3. **Recommendations & Feedback Loop**
     - Implement rule-based analyzer that inspects call summaries and suggests YAML tweaks (buffer warmup, fallback timeouts, pipeline swaps) exposed via Prometheus labels and a lightweight `/feedback/latest` endpoint.
     - Document how to interpret each recommendation and where to edit (`config/ai-agent.yaml`).
  4. **Dashboards & UX**
     - Curate Grafana dashboards: real-time call board, pipeline/model leaderboards, sentiment timeline, recommendation feed, transcript quick links.
     - Keep dashboards auto-provisioned (`monitoring/dashboards/`) so `make monitor-up` renders data without manual import.
  5. **Guided Setup for Non-Linux Users**
     - Deliver a helper script (e.g., `scripts/setup_monitoring.py`) that checks Docker, scaffolds `.env`, snapshots current YAML, enables the monitoring profile, and prints Grafana credentials/URL.
     - Update docs/Architecture, Agents.md, `.cursor/…`, `.windsurf/…`, `Gemini.md` to mention the optional workflow.
- **Acceptance & Fast Verification**:
  - `make monitor-up` (or helper script) starts Prometheus + Grafana; Grafana reachable on documented port with dashboards populated during a smoke call.
  - After a call, a transcript + metrics artifact is created and the recommendation endpoint lists at least one actionable suggestion referencing YAML keys.
  - Disabling the stack (`make monitor-down`) leaves core services unaffected and removes Prometheus/Grafana containers.

Keep this roadmap updated after each milestone to help any collaborator—or future AI assistant—pick up where we left off.
